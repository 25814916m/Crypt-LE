Revision history for Crypt-LE

0.17    14 May 2016
        - Additional functions set_domains/verified_domains have been added to work with domain names and to make it possible 
          to run the verification process before loading/generating a CSR.
        - The failed_domains method has been modified and now returns the list of domains failed the verification on any of 
          the request/accept/verify steps if called with a true value as a parameter. Otherwise the list of domains failed 
          the process on the most recently called request/accept/verify step gets returned (as usual).
        - Online resource to generate RSA keys and Certificate Signing Requests is referenced and to be available soon at
          https://get.zerossl.com/ (should help with CSR on Win32/Win64).

0.16    14 May 2016
        - Configuration changes to allow building PPM for pure Win23/Win64 environments.

0.15    01 April 2016
        - While generating a new CSR you can now use your existing key (if the file named in csr-key exists). Previously 
          generating a CSR would have also created a new key with it.
        - Even though tokens from LE should be technically safe (base64url), in case something gets changed by accident or 
          gets broken, they will be checked for matching the expected alphabet as per RFC 4648 section 5 (you don't want 
          something like / to sneak in).
        - Version typo fix.

0.14    28 March 2016
        - LICENSE file has been added.
        - Minimum Perl version is now explicitly specified.
        - A bit of tidying up.

0.13    28 March 2016
        - Simplified a few blocks of code in the client.
        - Moved pod in the client out of the way.
        - Added Markdown version of README.

0.12    27 March 2016
        - Library now supports 'logger' parameter to log debug messages via external logger (otherwise printed to STDOUT).
        - Client logging is now done via Log::Log4perl and supports --log-config parameter, so you can configure logging
          to your liking (example of a configuration file is given in help).
        - Client WILL NOT ask for domain verification now if previous verification results are still valid - that should
          allow renewals to be done without re-verification for about a year. Note: that makes --verified parameter obsolete.
        - Client now allows email to be used for registration.
        - Client is largely rewritten and the new home for the project is referenced (https://ZeroSSL.com)
        - On domain verification failure the error message is available now to callbacks under the 'error' key of results.
        - Crypt::LE::Complete::Simple can now use the logger passed to it by the client.
        - Crypt::LE::Complete::Simple is now also given a list of domains the certificate is issued for.
        - Crypt::LE::Challenge::Simple can now use the logger passed to it by the client (or other application).
        - Crypt::LE::Challenge::Simple now has DNS verification example added.
        - Client now supports basic DNS verification by using the following parameters in a command line:

          --handle-as dns --handle-with Crypt::LE::Challenge::Simple

0.11    21 March 2016
        - Added an option for conditional renew (--renew XX, where XX is the number of days left until expiration) to le.pl client.
          Expiration can be checked either locally (by reading an existing certificate file) or remotely (by connecting to the website
          using that certificate).
        - Added an option to unlink challenge files automatically (--unlink) to le.client. Note: it only works in combination with 
          existing --path option, which automatically places the challenge files into the target directory.

0.10    16 March 2016
        - Minor documentation changes.
        - Text in Crypt::LE::Challenge::Simple handler brought in line with le.pl.

0.09    15 March 2016
        - Client (and the library of course) now also supports optional callback for verification,
          so you can clean up challenge files or react in some way depending on the verification process outcome.
        - Minor documentation fixes.

0.08    15 March 2016
        - Added MIME::Base64 version dependency to make it work in a specific NetBSD environment.
        - Client le.pl will not require 'crt' parameter in generate-only mode any more.
        - Brushed up documentation.

0.07    14 March 2016
        - Certificate revocation now handles "already revoked" status better.
        - Both 'handle-params' and 'complete-params' can now take JSON document with parameters either directly or by reading it from file.
          So it should be now even easier to create 'handle' and 'complete' plugins and pass parameters to those without changing anything
          in the client itself.

0.06    14 March 2016
        - Added certificate revocation to both the library (Crypt::LE) and the client (le.pl).
        - Improved documentation and le.pl usage help.
        - Added HTTP::Tiny dependencies for NetBSD/OpenBSD boxes, which don't have IO::Socket::SSL and Net::SSLeay
          installed by default.

0.05    13 March 2016
        Client: In addition to be able to use external challenge handlers, le.pl can now also use completion handlers. Example:

        le.pl ... --complete-with Crypt::LE::Complete::Simple --complete-params '{"key1": 1, "key2": 2, "key3": "something"}'

        The module handling process completion should have a 'complete' method defined, to which both the completion data
        (including the domain and issuer's certificate, certificate file name and key file name) and the parameters given
        with '--complete-params' will be passed.

0.04    13 March 2016
        Library: accept_challenge() now takes optional parameters, which can be then passed to a callback.
        Client: le.pl now supports passing parameters to external challenge handling modules. Example:

        le.pl ... --handle-with Crypt::LE::Challenge::Simple --handle-params '{"key1": 1, "key2": 2, "key3": "something"}'

0.03    13 March 2016
        Client (le.pl) now supports "handle-with" and "handle-as" parameters, so external 
        challenge handling modules (such as Crypt::LE::Challenge::Simple) can be easily used.

0.02    12 March 2016
        Minor documentation fix.

0.01    12 March 2016
        Initial version.
